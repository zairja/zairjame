    <h2>I Can't Manifest a Thing, Can I?</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">1.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">From memory comes imagination</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">imagination ➡️ poetry</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">From poetry, memory </p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">2.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">We pull the words back and forth.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It's all memory transformed.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In the space between how it seems to me</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and how it seems to you,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Poetry lies.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">That's where not-you and not-I are.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">We briefly dance where not-we dance.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A dance of shadows, beneath the shade</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">of a sad willow tree,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">swallowing and swallowed by</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the dappled light.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Not-you asks what not-I dreams.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But I'm a coward -- flitting back across</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the cold stream whose touch causes</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">paralysis, amnesia, and rots the frozen fingers</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">with nostalgia -- running with hummingbird wings</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">on my feet, messenger between the goddesses,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">spilling water & sugar, coming home with an empty bucket,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">home to leeches groping beneath me, curses</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">raining down on my head, sleeplessness,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and the smell of chicken shit.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'm a coward who should've replied 'not-you' or 'you'.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Instead I ran from the simple answer: not-you you. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">I remember loving you endlessly</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">in that no-place, utopia, you-topia,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the place of you,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Not-you, not-I.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">So it will happen, supposedly,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">or at least happens there</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In the in-between</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you remember now,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">having read my memory, imagined,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and made your own memory.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Willed into existence, but not really.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">If only it were the same.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">If only it were so</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and not just a memory. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">At first I thought not-you and not-I</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">were like shadows or opposites</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">or potentialities or fluids or ineffable.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But it was much simpler in the end.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I am not you.</p>
