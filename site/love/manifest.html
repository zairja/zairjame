    <h2>I Can't Manifest a Thing, Can I </h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">1.
    <p class="poetry-line">From memory comes imagination
    <p class="poetry-line">imagination ➡️ poetry
    <p class="poetry-line">From poetry, memory 
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">2.
    <p class="poetry-line">We pull the words back and forth.
    <p class="poetry-line">It's all memory transformed.
    <p class="poetry-line">In the space between how it seems to me
    <p class="poetry-line">and how it seems to you,
    <p class="poetry-line">Poetry lies.
    <p class="poetry-line">That's where not-you and not-I are.
    <p class="poetry-line">We briefly dance where not-we dance.
    <p class="poetry-line">A dance of shadows, beneath the shade
    <p class="poetry-line">of a sad willow tree,
    <p class="poetry-line">swallowing and swallowed by
    <p class="poetry-line">the dappled light.
    <p class="poetry-line">Not-you asks what not-I dreams.
    <p class="poetry-line">But I'm a coward -- flitting back across
    <p class="poetry-line">the cold stream whose touch causes
    <p class="poetry-line">paralysis, amnesia, and rots the frozen fingers
    <p class="poetry-line">with nostalgia -- running with hummingbird wings
    <p class="poetry-line">on my feet, messenger between the goddesses,
    <p class="poetry-line">spilling water & sugar, coming home with an empty bucket,
    <p class="poetry-line">home to leeches groping beneath me, curses
    <p class="poetry-line">raining down on my head, sleeplessness,
    <p class="poetry-line">and the smell of chicken shit.
    <p class="poetry-line">I'm a coward who should've replied 'not-you' or 'you'.
    <p class="poetry-line">Instead I ran from the simple answer: not-you you. 
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">I remember loving you endlessly</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">in that no-place, utopia, you-topia,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the place of you,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Not-you, not-I.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">So it will happen, supposedly,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">or at least happens there</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In the in-between</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you remember now,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">having read my memory, imagined,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and made your own memory.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Willed into existence, but not really.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">If only it were the same.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">If only it were so</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and not just a memory. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">At first I thought not-you and not-I</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">were like shadows or opposites</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">or potentialities or fluids or ineffable.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But it was much simpler in the end.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I am not you.</p>
