    <h2>I'm looking for...</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">I've looked for a wealthy man with nice hair</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A good man or good enough man</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I can't find him anywhere</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I imagine you've no trouble finding candidates</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">They will want you for your beauty,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Your charms, your personality,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Rizz, artistic creativity,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But all of that wanes and shifts</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Like an inverse eclipse.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">For it's one thing to be desired</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And another to be cared for.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And who says either one is higher?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Although clever turnips of great fame</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Will convince you they're one and the same.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Look past looks, past value,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Past what you bring to the table,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Past the illusory soul, past religious fable,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Past the useful lies and sad truths.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You deserve one who recognizes your shape</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And what's coming together.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It's simple for us to trace this hidden geometry</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">To share a shape</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Ever in flux, chaos, and wrath</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Whose unknown boundary</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Can't be expressed in our highest math.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I am looking for a simple man, a fractal,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">An infinite coastline, an empty head</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Whose heart is full</p>
    <br>
