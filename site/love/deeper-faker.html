    <h2>deeper faker</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">Deeper, faker</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Creeper, taker</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Dreamer, maker</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Sleeper, waker</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">It speaks with your voice,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But not your words.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It has your face,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But without your smile.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It says what I want,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And acts like I want it to.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Everyone is making them,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Until we can make ourselves.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Everyone agreed it's better this way.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">No one to hurt and no one to save.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">As careless as a wish,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Be whoever you want to be.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Will we blur together like schools of fish,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Or say "stop copying me"?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Our legs grow long,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Then get cut down to size.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Muscle and fat,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Take any shape you like.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">A lion body and the head of a man,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Or maybe vice versa.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A ship will launch a thousand faces,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Leaving behind souls and viscera,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In search of new ways to fuck,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">To reproduce image and ephemera.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">We could each wear the mask</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The other fell in love with.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Only mine would have to change.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Love, I'm so afraid</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">We won't recognize one another,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Our visages unaged.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">How will I know you?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">When you return from the egg,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">How will I know if it's you</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Or a stranger in your yesterday's skin?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">How could we ever know</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And were we ever meant to?</p>
