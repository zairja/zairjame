    <h2>October Girl</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">In a season of decline, one lone butterfly</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Emerges anew--apart from the grubby masses,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Consuming caterpillars--gazes down to espy</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">What's left behind; amid flowers, holds classes</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">For the leaf-eaters yet to turn new ones.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In a season of decline, one lone professor</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Sets down the king's pen, which writ collegiate</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Canon, and inspects the peasant's pencil, for</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Its words reached each fallen mind by a secret</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Leading down hidden paths, low roads to heaven.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Yet the pencil marks are rubbed out by erasers,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Washed away by the Lethe, trampled by marching</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Militants and machines, left in old dressers,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Written over by dissectors of a butterfly wing,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Leaving an empty cocoon without mystery.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Alas, my car swiped her, a windshield wiper</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Swept her aside. It's dangerous beyond the green</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Safety of the veiled wood. But I'll remember</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The flourish of her patterns in deep dreams.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Wait! She flutters off! There goes my bookmark!</p>
