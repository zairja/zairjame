    <h2>unnamed</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">they got the dragon, Loong, from the flag of the Qing dynasty</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">tattooed back home in Manila,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">said it was a gang thing but that may have been a bluff,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and I wanted badly to trace the scales along the fur of their forearm,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">while the charming rasp of a voice that&#39;s been smoking since it was 10</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">told me this place of mesquite and mosquitoes was as boring</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">as our job counting heads in the colonias.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">so we went about our census duties,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">looking like a couple of mormon missionaries,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">lean frames in oversized attire,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">stained cuffs from Milano&#39;s marinara.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">at the last trailer-home, I recited the Spanish on the questionnaire,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">then asked the lady in the doorway about her esposa. ¿esposa?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">she cocked her head and laughed -- ah, esposo.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">only a vowel to me, ignorant as I am.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">later, as we lay, seats back, in my old toyota,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I&#39;ve already forgot the distinction, meaning only to kiss</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">their small, plain face carried with such ease,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">that I could carry it as gently as our lips now touching,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">no boxes to check or hovering questions –</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">only the certainty of skin to skin.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">we stop as soon as we begin</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">because I was stupid and afraid.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you never come for coffee at savory perks or wait for me at the skating rink after work.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">another decade, I&#39;m taking census of the dirt.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">new identities and orientations, my sister&#39;s partner&#39;s pronouns,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">new checkboxes and new sounds,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and I remember these all the same,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but all I want is to remember their name.</p>
