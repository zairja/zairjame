    <h2>The Big Z [pre-2010]</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">to step out of the world</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">fella ya fell for a spell</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">things that can't be shared</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">whispered to the frozen stars &amp; snowflakes seen from an abandoned truck stop</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">words etched in ice, written in snow</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">secret ways of old travelers</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the young couples in front of the art</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">is there any point in the telling</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">in documenting</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">for me or future me or posterity</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i want you to know but you don't follow</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">workin for the big Z</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">big letters in front of my name</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">self-love bullshit</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">not talking about the hurt</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">eat your school, drink your teeth, don't do sleep, and get 8 hours of drugs</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">stop looking</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">lower your expectations</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">reject self-love, reject self-care, reject the self</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">leave the valley</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">find a new goddess to worship</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">craft songs and lay them at her feet</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">to be ignored</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">lay money at her feet</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">to be picked up</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">build her stairs</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">to be ascended</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">statistically all species are extinct</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">my personal extinction isn't so bad</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">everyone thinks it ends with them</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but the flowers keep blooming</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">only, i wonder of the infinite tyrannies to come</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the infinite silences</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">nothing blooming forever</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">is just as likely,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">is the true state of things</p>
