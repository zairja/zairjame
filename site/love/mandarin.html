    <h2>Mandarin [piratical tale from 2003]</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">Avast all ye maties, I'll tell ye a tale</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Of pirates and plunders, of mast, oar and sail!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Of the bonniest lass that ever has been!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">On all Seven Seas she was called Mandarin.</p>
    <br>    
    <p class="poetry-line">Her hair was as black as the bottomless sea.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Y'argh, and her eyes, all a'glitterin' they be!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Her kiss dropped a hand like a great clap o' thunder;</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Her voice poured out shanties that left Jacks t'wonder.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">What mate had the honor to have such a beauty?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Well, listen close lads, and I'll tell ye smartly!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">T'was Cap'n M--- Pinguin of the good ship Naobi,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A fine, stout young Captain, just two short of twenty!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A fresh privateer who was on the account,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Who acquired such a booty as no man could amount.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Alas, he drew envy from all swabs and squiffies,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">So that on his head had been placed many bounties.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Many scurvy sprogs had hung the jib at such a call,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">To be the Pinguin's captive meant a certain keelhaul!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Yet scalliwags with greed in heart still chose to make the chase,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And so i't'was that this young mate got caught up in a race.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">Splice the mainbrace once again to jog my memory!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">All I need's some ale, ye sea-dogs, </p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Then on shall go me story!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">A'headin' into home port where awaited Mandarin,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The Cap'n found an ambush as the ocean's never seen.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Calmly Captain Pinguin watched red sails pulled full mast,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The other ships would give no quart'r, time fer peace was passed.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The fate of this corsair was clear: He'd Dance the Hempen Jig.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">That is, if that young pirate's love just hadn't been so big.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You see, 'is lass'd wait for 'im upon thar sandy coast.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">She 'ad a stronger tie to 'im than any man could boast.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">And so it was he drove his ship straight into those marauders,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Them fearless eyes alone sent thirty down to Jonesy's Locker!</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">His deadlights burnt with fiercest rage.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">To all the ships he cried, "Gangway!"</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Until he came wit'in thar range</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And loosed his guns acrost the bay.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">So deadly was his cannon's aim</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It earned himself a new nickname,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Which no one 'ere can rightly say</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Since no Jack 'ere survived that day.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poetry-line">From that day forth no mate 'as e'er caught wind a that Pinguin,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But every seaman worth 'is salt knows 'e's with Mandarin.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Some folks think he quit the sea to live a life on land,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And built 'is own small ship o' sorts on oceans made o' sand.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I, fer one, don't rightly know, 'tis not me place to speak.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Alls I've spied are two-pair a footprints on a' empty beach.</p>
