    <h2>The Exchange</h2>
    <h3>him:</h3>
    <p class="poetry-line">Good looks and money.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">These are my values, honey.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Sweetie, there are thousands lined up</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Around the block when I'm through with you.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Don't pretend if we were switched</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It's what you wouldn't do.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You can pull anyone. And so can I.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Now let me show you a good time.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You think you can do better than this?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Maybe if you dated a six?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Well I got news about my sex,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">In every rank are pieces of shit.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">So you may as well partake of the top</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Than debase yourself with lowly slop.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And if it's too transactional,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Remember this relationship is provisional.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I buy you clothes and food and gas;</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You give me head and throw some ass.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And when you're tired, there's the door.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'll find another common whore.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>her:</h3>
    <p class="poetry-line">I want to laugh but have to puke.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But first you'll hear my brief rebuke,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You fuck. You human paraquat.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You really think you have a shot?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I could finesse with pure attraction,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But won't give you the satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I've been with losers, broke and rich,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Who couldn't handle this bad bitch.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You really think that you're the best?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Nah, I'll admit you got me pressed.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Lit up, you think your thoughts are deep.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">That rambling put me right to sleep.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You could have a whole ass airplane hangar,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Yet have no goddam table manners.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Dude, you are a fuckin joke,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">A clown from the first word you spoke.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Sorry your mom did such a shit job.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Corny ah speech, put you on the cob.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The only pussy you can get</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Is the one that starts with pocket.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You had an AI girlfriend once,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Who ghosted you in less than a month.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Thanks for the free tank of gas.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">But as for you, that's a hard pass.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Like you say, I'm a catch and don't need you,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">With your head up your ass, enjoy the view.</p>
