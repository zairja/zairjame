    <p class="poetry-line">i don't gotta say it</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">unless you wanna hear it.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i wanna hear you say it</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">unless you can't,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">so it's better to be silent.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">lemme go wild looking for signs,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">reading tea leaves, animal bones,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and recipes on gravestones.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i go mad remembering you</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">describing the effects of ecstasy,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">brushing your finger along my forearms.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and it is ecstasy.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i felt, briefly.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">did you say you never danced before</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">or that it wasn't fun before?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i don't believe you</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but i know better than to question.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">if you lie, you tell the right lies.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i'm lost, imaginging your sighs.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">don't people-please me,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you don't got to.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i know the songs and selfies</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">are for someone elseee,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but i love how you let me pretend.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">my heart rises in my throat</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">like i'm gonna choke.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">uh, maybe i drank too much coke.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">oh well, you'll never owe a thing.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">on high days, i think i'll lead,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but fear you won't follow,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">so i let it be.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">no, you don't owe a thing.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i wasn't born the day before</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">but i was born early</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and i lied to get in school</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and i love to play your fool.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i would defend your every crime.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i'll post the bail every time.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i might never call you mine,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">yet i'm yours.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and we don't gotta say it</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">cuz somehow i can hear it.</p>
