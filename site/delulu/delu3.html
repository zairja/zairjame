    <h2>DELUSIONS PT 3</h2>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'm not tired.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'm ageless.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'm not bored yet.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I came out of a cave where old couples shuffle</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and sit in stillness 'til they form stalagmites.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The air down there is surprisingly cool,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the couples so quiet.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Just don't forget a flashlight.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Our faces will crack like the floor of Death Valley.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It doesn't scare me.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">The love keeps pouring out from the ceiling,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">filling the inland empire and all our wrinkles.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I'll love you then as now, maybe more.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I can't turn a phrase or your face to mine.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I can turn a phase of madness into a life.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I come back so many times.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Water cycle ain't got shit on me.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I came for everything.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Noah's water ain't got shit on me.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I was a turtle and a forest,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">a gestalt, an entity, a process.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">What can I say that you don't know?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">You'll get bored and watch me grow old.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It's how you move in time.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">It's how you move.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Maybe I wasn't in time.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Maybe I wasn't. Maybe I was.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">I can't stop coming back for you.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">And I'm not sorry.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">Water cycle ain't got shit on me.</p>
