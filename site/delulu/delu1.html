    <h2>DELUSIONS PT 1</h2>

    <p class="poetry-line">if i could shout my love as loud as the sun,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">roaring and radiating at all frequencies,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">intense as an alien weapon,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you better wear nuclear shades,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">get to the bunker, make peace.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">love that obliterates, incinerates,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">love that hates,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">vectors of pain,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">yearning paths,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">happy haha paths,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">cloud cuckoo land crap,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the mess of some mammal i glanced</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">at on the roadside,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">a trap, the ruler of yap,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">love that waits until sunset.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">stupid words, like love.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">there's a spectrum of light</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and waves, fields, energies,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and disjointed unities</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">we can't perceive, like love.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">sick of hearing about it,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">it's been talked about enough.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">something made up, like electron clouds</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and Feynman diagrams, an equation</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">to explain the burning.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">stop saying love. too much shouting.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the sun isn't looking at me, you, or anyone.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the sun doesn't look at all.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">burning all the same.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">the way you don't recognize me</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and my dreams are peeling my skin off</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">from a sunburn. sure, that's love.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">yeah, love is the sweatless heat</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and horrible itch from laying on the beach</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">too long with the sun blaring, not gazing,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">swaying without a care, no notice of me,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">while i shrivel into self-delusions.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">stay hydrated, baby. don't call me baby.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i wasn't around until a mirror,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">emerged or immersed, who knows,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">from a puddle where birds dipped wings.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">wtf am i saying? where's it come from?</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i'm tired of borrowing words and writing.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">tomorrow or the one after</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">i'm kicking away the keyboard</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">and digging the burrow</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">where we can curl up together.</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">you won't need to read anymore,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">our lips pressing one another in silent talk,</p>
    <p class="poetry-line">burning the dictionary for warmth.</p>
